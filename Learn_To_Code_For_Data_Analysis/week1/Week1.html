    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </br>
        <p>Here you will write code in Python - language named after the comedy group Monty Python.</br>
        Here it's used an environment called Jupyter, which alows to write notebooks that includes Python code. Jupyter is used by many scientists and data analysts as part of their workflow.
        </p>

    <h1>Install the Software</h1>
    </br>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Online CoCalc service</li>
            <li>Install Anaconda package</li>
            <li>Notebooks</li>
        </ul></p>
        </br>
        <h2>Start with a Question</h2>
        </br>
        <p>A question leads to data that can answer it, and looking at the available data helps to make a question precise or may trigger new questions, which, in turn, may require further data.</br>
            Data analysis is thus often an iterative process: the questions determine which data to obtain, and the data influences which questions to ask and what the scope of the analysis is.</p>
